Part of our "My First Genome Assembly" course written by myself and Christophe Patterson. 

Here we compare genome assembly statistics of three genome assemblies using the software QUAST.

What statistics do we see? 

One of these genomes was assembled from short-read data whereas the other two were assembled from long-read data. Which genome is was assembled from short-read? How can you tell?
